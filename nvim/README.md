# Neovim configuration

I'm just starting with vim. This is my configuration. It is mostly copy pasted from various sources.

## Installation

First, install `nvim`.

```
brew install nvim
```

Then clone this repository under the `~/.config/nvim` directory.

```
cd ~/config
mkdir nvim
cd nvim
git clone https://github.com/Tvergara/nvim.git 
```

Now open `nvim` and run `:PlugInstall`.

Finally, if you want to setup Github Copilot, run

```
:Copilot setup
```
And you are done :tada:
